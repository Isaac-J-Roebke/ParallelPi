The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) boost/1.72.0 => boost/1.75.0

mpiexec detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[3240,1],0]

Open MPI tried to fork a new process via the "execve" system call but
failed.  Open MPI checks many things before attempting to launch a
child process, but nothing is perfect. This error may be indicative
of another problem on the target host, or even something as silly as
having specified a directory for your application. Your job will now
abort.

mpiexec was unable to start the specified application as it encountered an
error:

Error code: -125
Error name: The specified application failed to start

when attempting to start process rank 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec was unable to find the specified executable file, and therefore
did not launch the job.  This error was first reported for process
rank 0; it may have occurred for other processes as well.

NOTE: A common cause for this error is misspelling a mpiexec command
      line parameter option (remember that mpiexec interprets the first
      unrecognized command line token as the executable).
